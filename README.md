# Broadcastify SMS Notifier
Send emails when a specific Broadcastify feed is an alerting (you must be the owner of the feed)

Although this mentions SMS, this script uses the email-based SMS messaging that most mobile carriers provide.

## To Use
Update the env file with your Broadcastify username and password.
Emails are handled by a email service. MailerSend is used in this script (mailersend.com). Get an API token from this service.

## Docker
To run, simply build the container and then run it:

1. `docker build -t notifier .`
2. `docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app --env-file env feed`
